## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- TON Wallet (for testing)
- Telegram Bot Token (for group management)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/haronmwass/tonthreads.git
cd tonthreads
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd server
npm install
```

### Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the server directory:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ton-threads
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here
DEMO_CHAT_ID=123456789
TON_NETWORK_ENDPOINT=https://main.ton.dev
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

### Setting up Telegram Bot (Optional for Demo)
1. Create a new bot by messaging [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram
2. Use `/newbot` command and follow the instructions
3. Copy the bot token and add it to your `.env` file
4. Add the bot as admin to your Telegram groups/channels
5. Get your group/channel ID and add it to DEMO_CHAT_ID in .env
6. For demo purposes, you can leave the token empty - the app will work in demo mode

### Start the Application
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
npm run dev:full

# Or start them separately
npm run dev      # Frontend
npm run server   # Backend
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Frontend tests
npm test

# Backend tests
cd server
npm test
```

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests for core components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Smart contract tests using Hardhat
- End-to-end tests for user flows

## üöÄ Deployment

### Frontend (Netlify/Vercel)
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy the dist folder
```

### Backend (Railway/Heroku)
```bash
cd server
npm start
# Configure environment variables
```

### Smart Contracts
```bash
# Deploy to TON network
npx hardhat deploy --network ton-mainnet
```

##  Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are sanitized and validated
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints are rate-limited to prevent abuse
- **Transaction Verification**: On-chain verification of all payments
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control for admin functions
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
